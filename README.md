Addition package with unit tests
---------------------


### Content of +addition

The addition package contains two addition functions which return input arguments plus 'something'
* addTwo; returns input arguments plus 2
* addFour; returns input arguments plus 4


### Other content

In the assignment7 folder, files are added to test whether the functions in +addition work
* testAdditionCases; a script that invokes functions to test whether the addition functions work for specific example cases
* A function that tests whether addTwo does what it is supposed to do (invoked by the script)
* A function that tests whether addFour does what it is supposed to do (also invoked by the script)
